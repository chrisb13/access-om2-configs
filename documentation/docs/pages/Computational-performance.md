## Scaling and Performance

Typical resource requirements on raijin are:

| Model | Grid spacing | Domain | Baroclinic timestep (s) | MOM cores | CICE cores | Walltime (hr/yr) | CPU (hr/yr) | Memory (Gb) |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| ACCESS-OM2 | 1° | 360 × 300 × 50 | 5400 | 216 | 24 | 0.38 | 118 | 83 |
| ACCESS-OM2-025 | 0.25° | 1440 × 1080 × 50 | 1350-1800 | 1455 | 361 | 2.6 | 4,700 | 522 |
| ACCESS-OM2-01 | 0.1° | 3600 × 2700 × 75 | 540 | 4358 | 799 | 10.4 | 68,000 | 2437 |

Scaling and performance are discussed in sec 3 of [Kiss et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-106); the corresponding plot scripts and data are [here](https://github.com/COSIMA/ACCESS-OM2-1-025-010deg-report/tree/master/figures/scaling_mom_cice). Note that the current 0.1 degree configuration (in table above) requires about half the walltime and CPU hours of the configuration in table 2 of the paper.

Details of run performance are given in .csv tables auto-generated by https://github.com/aekiss/run_summary in `/g/data/hh5/tmp/cosima/access-om2-run-summaries` on NCI. Some analysis plots using this data are [here](https://github.com/aekiss/notebooks/blob/master/run_summary.ipynb).
